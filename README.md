üìà Six Sigma Quality Command Center
![alt text](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)
A comprehensive Streamlit application designed as the primary digital toolkit for a Quality and Process Improvement Engineer. This command center provides the tools to drive continuous improvement, cost savings, and process efficiency across global manufacturing sites.
The application is built around the core principles of Six Sigma and Lean manufacturing, offering interactive dashboards for monitoring KPIs, executing DMAIC projects, optimizing product release strategies, and leveraging predictive analytics to foster a culture of "Quality at the Source."
Key Features
This application is organized into five purpose-built modules:
üåç Global Operations Dashboard: A high-level view of quality performance across all sites, focusing on KPIs like Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ), First Time Right (FTR), and scrap rates. Includes tools for trend analysis and site-to-site comparison.
üõ†Ô∏è DMAIC Improvement Toolkit: An interactive workspace for managing and executing formal Six Sigma (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) projects. Each phase is equipped with relevant statistical tools like process capability analysis and control charts.
‚úÖ Product Release Optimization Suite: A suite of tools to move away from traditional inspection towards data-driven lot acceptance. Includes a Test Effectiveness Analyzer (ROC/AUC) and a Sampling Plan Simulator to balance risk and cost.
üéì Kaizen & Training Hub: A central repository for logging the outcomes of continuous improvement (Kaizen) events and hosting a library of training materials on quality methodologies to support coaching and knowledge sharing.
üîÆ Predictive Quality Lab: A machine learning workbench for developing and evaluating models that predict final product quality from in-process sensor data, enabling a proactive approach to defect prevention.
