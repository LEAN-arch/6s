# six_sigma/app.py
"""
Main application entry point for the Six Sigma Master Black Belt (MBB) Command Center.

This Streamlit application is the primary digital workspace for a Six Sigma MBB,
focused on executing high-impact improvement projects. The architecture is
centered on the DMAIC methodology, supported by deep-dive analytical modules
for identifying and quantifying opportunities (COPQ, FTY) and for advanced
statistical analysis.

SME Overhaul:
- The entire application architecture is now centered on the DMAIC workflow.
- A professional sidebar navigation is used instead of tabs.
- Imports are updated to reflect new, dedicated modules for FTY, COPQ, and advanced tools.
- Branding and titles are elevated to reflect an expert-level, MBB-focused toolkit.
