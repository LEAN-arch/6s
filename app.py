"""
Main application entry point for the Six Sigma Master Black Belt (MBB) Command Center.

This Streamlit application serves as the primary digital workspace for a Six Sigma
MBB, designed for managing and executing a portfolio of high-impact process
improvement projects. The architecture is centered on the DMAIC methodology and
is supported by a suite of sophisticated dashboards for strategic oversight,
deep-dive analysis, and advanced statistical modeling.

SME Definitive Overhaul:
- The fragile, custom path-correction block has been replaced with a new,
  bulletproof version that makes the application self-sufficient and runnable
  from any directory using the standard `streamlit run` command.
- A sophisticated sidebar navigation organizes the platform into logical, icon-driven
  workspaces, significantly improving user experience.
- All modules are fully integrated, and redundant/deprecated modules have been removed,
  resulting in a clean and maintainable codebase.

# to the system path, ensuring that all `from six_sigma...` imports work
# reliably, regardless of how the script is executed.
