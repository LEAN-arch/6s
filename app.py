"""
Main application entry point for the Six Sigma Master Black Belt (MBB) Command Center.

This Streamlit application serves as the primary digital workspace for a Six Sigma
MBB, designed for managing and executing a portfolio of high-impact process
improvement projects. The architecture is centered on the DMAIC methodology and
is supported by a suite of sophisticated dashboards for strategic oversight,
deep-dive analysis, and advanced statistical modeling.

SME Definitive Overhaul:
- The fragile, custom path-correction block has been removed in favor of the
  standard, robust `python -m` execution method.
- A sophisticated sidebar navigation organizes the platform into logical, icon-driven
  workspaces, significantly improving user experience.
- All modules are fully integrated, and redundant/deprecated modules have been removed,
  resulting in a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Enhanced error handling and user guidance.
