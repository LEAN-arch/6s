"""
Renders the Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ) Analysis Center, a dashboard dedicated
to translating process failures into financial terms.

This module provides a dedicated workbench for deep-dive analysis into the
drivers of COPQ. It allows an MBB to dissect costs by failure type, category,
and site, using tools like Pareto analysis to identify the most impactful areas
for cost-saving initiatives. It serves as the financial justification for the
problems identified in the FTY dashboard.

SME Overhaul:
- Tightly integrated with the data narrative to ensure the Pareto analysis
  correctly identifies the financial impact of the engineered process bottleneck.
- The Pareto chart has been upgraded to a publication-quality standard, including
  an "80/20" line to visually emphasize the vital few.
- The 'Learn More' section provides an expert-level explanation of COPQ strategy.
- The 'Actionable Insights' section is now a dynamic, data-driven call to action.
- All visualizations have been polished for clarity and professional impact.

        **Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ)** represents all the money a company loses because its processes are not perfect. It's a powerful way to get management attention and justify resources for improvement projects.

        COPQ is typically broken into two main categories:

        - **Internal Failure Costs:** Costs from defects caught *before* reaching the customer.
          - _Examples: Scrapping a bad part, time spent on rework, re-testing a product._
          - _Impact:_ These are bad. They waste time, material, and capacity.

        - **External Failure Costs:** Costs from defects that *reach the customer*.
          - _Examples: Warranty claims, product recalls, field service trips, complaint handling, brand reputation damage._
          - _Impact:_ These are **disastrous**. They are exponentially more expensive than internal failures and can lead to lost customers and market share.

        **A key quality strategy is to convert external failures into internal ones (by improving inspection) and then eliminate the internal failures (by improving the process).**
