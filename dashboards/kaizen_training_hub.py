"""
Renders the Continuous Improvement & Knowledge Hub.

This module serves as a central repository for documenting continuous improvement
(Kaizen) events and for hosting training materials related to quality principles.
It supports the MBB's role in coaching, mentoring, and fostering a culture of
quality by sharing successes and enabling skill development.

SME Overhaul (Kaizen Leader Edition):
- The content has been fully populated with academic-grade, actionable materials
  that reflect the principles of Lean (Imai, Shingo, Ohno) and Six Sigma (Deming).
- The Kaizen Event Log is now structured to mirror A3 Thinking, providing deep
  insights into the problem-solving process, with realistic 'redacted' content.
- The Training Library is now a comprehensive curriculum with detailed descriptions,
  learning objectives, and references to foundational literature.
- The UI/UX has been completely redesigned for a professional, engaging, and
  authoritative "knowledge base" feel, using modern layouts and better visual hierarchy.
- All text has been rewritten to inspire action, promote a learning culture,
  and articulate the 'Why' behind continuous improvement.

                1.  **Converted Internal to External:** Designed a pre-heating cart for the next die set.

                1.  **Sort:** Red-tagged all non-essential items; 3 skids of clutter were removed.
                2.  **Set in Order:** Created shadow boards for all hand tools. Implemented a color-coded bin system for fasteners.
                3.  **Shine:** Conducted a deep clean and established a daily 5-minute cleaning schedule.
                4.  **Standardize:** Laminated standard work instructions for tool placement and end-of-shift cleanup.
