"""
Renders the expert-level DMAIC Improvement Project Toolkit, the core operational
workspace for project execution within the Command Center.

This module provides an interactive, end-to-end environment for executing
complex Six Sigma projects. It guides an MBB through each phase of the DMAIC
methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), embedding the
application's advanced statistical and plotting utilities directly into the
project workflow.

SME Masterclass Overhaul:
- Architected as a fully integrated, DYNAMIC project-centric workspace. Selecting
  a project now loads a dataset SPECIFIC to that project's problem.
- **Embedded Coach Design:** Every phase, tool, and result is now accompanied
  by detailed SME explanations, including the purpose, methodology, mathematical
  basis, and interpretation of each analysis.
- **Visually Rich & Robust:** All tollgate documents are enhanced with professional
  visualizations and wrapped in individual try-except blocks for graceful degradation.
- **RSM Integration:** The Improve phase includes a full Response Surface
  Methodology (RSM) analysis to demonstrate true process optimization.
- All code is robust, modular, and free of previously identified bugs.

        - **Process Stability (via Control Chart):** A process must be stable (in statistical control) before its capability can be assessed. An I-MR chart is used to check for special causes of variation that make the process unpredictable.
        - **Process Capability (Ppk):** This metric tells us how well the process can meet customer specifications.

          - **Interpretation:** It measures the distance from the process mean to the nearest specification limit, divided by 3 standard deviations. A Ppk of 1.33 is a common minimum target, representing a highly capable process.

If the measurement tool itself has too much variation, it can mask the true variation of the process we are trying to improve. It answers the question: "Are we measuring the process, or are we measuring the measurement system?"
        
        **Methodology (ANOVA):** The ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) method is used to decompose the total observed variation into its components:
        - **Part-to-Part Variation (PV):** The true, actual variation between the different parts being measured. We want this to be high.
        - **Repeatability (EV):** Variation from the measurement instrument (the "Equipment Variation"). This is the variation seen when one operator measures the same part multiple times.
        - **Reproducibility (AV):** Variation from the operators (the "Appraiser Variation"). This is the variation seen when different operators measure the same part.
        - **Total Gage R&R:** The sum of Repeatability and Reproducibility.
        
        **Key Metric: % Contribution**
        - **Formula:** `(% Contribution) = (Component Variance / Total Variance) * 100`
        - **Interpretation:** A Total Gage R&R % Contribution of **<10%** is considered acceptable. A value **>30%** is unacceptable and indicates the measurement system must be fixed before proceeding with the project.
